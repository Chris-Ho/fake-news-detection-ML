# fake-news-detection-ML-approach
Individual Project completed in the third year of University (final year of the BSc). 

Project aimed to build a machine learning approach to detect fake news given an article. 

Approach was as follows:

  1. Research the problem domain and understand what the existing approaches are
  2. Follow up on existing approaches and evaluate the best approach to take 
  3. Collect appropriate data and clean data for use in training
  4. Choose an approach to take and train with different machine learning algorithms
  5. Optimise hyperparameters
  6. See results

To run the code yourself download the data files and run the code in the Jupyter Notebook.

Alternatively, to just view the code, click on the Notebook.
